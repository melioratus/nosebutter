    <h1>Division A - Agriculture, Forestry, And Fishing</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes establishments primarily engaged in agricultural production, forestry, commercial fishing, hunting and trapping, and related services. 

The classification of agricultural production covers establishments (e.g., farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, hatcheries) primarily engaged in the production of crops, plants, vines, or trees (excluding forestry operations); and the keeping, grazing, or feeding of livestock for the sale of livestock or livestock products (including serums), for livestock increase, or for value increase. Livestock as used here includes cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, and poultry. Also included are animal specialties, such as horses, rabbits, bees, pets, fur-bearing animals in captivity, and fish in captivity. Agricultural production also includes establishments primarily engaged in the operation of sod farms, cranberry bogs, and poultry hatcheries; in the production of mushrooms, bulbs, flower seeds, and vegetable seeds; and in the growing of hydroponic crops. 

Farms are the establishment units generally utilized for the purpose of industrial classification of agricultural production. A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures. For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented. It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm. 

The classification of agricultural services includes establishments primarily engaged in supplying soil preparation services, crop services, landscape and horticultural services, veterinary and other animal services, and farm labor and management services. 

The classification of forestry covers establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, or forest nurseries; in the gathering of forest products; or in performing forestry services. Logging establishments are classified in Manufacturing, Industry 2411. 

The classification of fishing and hunting and trapping covers establishments primarily engaged in commercial fishing (including shellfish and marine products); in operating fish hatcheries and fish and game preserves; and in commercial hunting and trapping. 

Establishments which produce agricultural commodities and sell them directly to the general public for personal or household consumption are classified in Major Groups 01 and 02.

    <section id="major-group-01" title="Agricultural Production Crops">
      <h1>Major Group 01 - Agricultural Production Crops</h1>
      
<div>

<div>
This major group includes establishments (e.g., farms, orchards, greenhouses, nurseries) primarily engaged in the production of crops, plants, vines, and trees (excluding forestry operations). This major group also includes establishments primarily engaged in the operation of sod farms, and cranberry bogs; in the production of mushrooms, bulbs, flower seeds, and vegetable seeds; and in the growing of hydroponic crops. Seeds of field crops are classified in the same industry as crops grown for other purposes. 

An establishment primarily engaged in crop production (Major Group 01) is classified in the industry (four-digit) and industry group (three-digit) which accounts for 50 percent or more of the total value of sales for its agricultural production. If the total value of sales for agricultural products of an establishment is less than 50 percent from a single four-digit industry, but 50 percent or more of the value of sales for its agricultural products derives from the products of two or more four-digit industries within the same three-digit industry group, the establishment is classified in the miscellaneous industry of that industry group; otherwise, it is classified as a general crop farm in Industry 0191. Establishments that derive 50 percent or more of the value of sales from horticultural specialties of Industry Group 018 are classified in Industry 0181 or Industry 0182 according to their primary activity.

    <h1>Division B - Mining</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes all establishments primarily engaged in mining. The term mining is used in the broad sense to include the extraction of minerals occurring naturally: solids, such as coal and ores; liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gases such as natural gas. The term mining is also used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, milling (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, flotation), and other preparation customarily done at the mine site, or as a part of mining activity. 

Exploration and development of mineral properties are included. Services performed on a contract or fee basis in the development or operation of mineral properties are classified separately but within this division. Establishments which have complete responsibility for operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells for others on a contract or fee basis are classified according to the product mined rather than as mineral services. 

Mining operations are classified, by industry, on the basis of the principal mineral produced, or, if there is no production, on the basis of the principal mineral for which exploration or development work is in process. The mining of culm banks, ore dumps, and tailing piles is classified as mining according to the principal mineral product derived. 

The purification and distribution of water is classified in Transportation and Public Utilities, Industry 4941, and the bottling and distribution of natural spring and mineral waters is classified in Wholesale Trade, Industry 5149. 

Crushing, grinding, or otherwise preparing clay, ceramic, and refractory minerals; barite, and miscellaneous nonmetallic minerals, except fuels, not in conjunction with mining or quarrying operations, are classified in Manufacturing, Industry 3295. Dressing of stone or slabs is classified in Manufacturing, Industry 3281, whether or not mining is done at the same establishment.

<div>

<div>
This major group includes establishments primarily engaged in mining, developing mines, or exploring for metallic minerals (ores). These ores are valued chiefly for the metals contained, to be recovered for use as such or as constituents of alloys, chemicals, pigments or other products. This major group also includes all ore dressing and beneficiating operations, whether performed at mills operated in conjunction with the mines served or at mills, such as custom mills, operated separately. These include mills which crush, grind, wash, dry, sinter, calcine, or leach ore, or perform gravity separation or flotation operations. Magnesite and brucite operations are classified in Industry 1459, and crushed dolomite operations are classified in Industry 1422. Smelters and refineries are classified in Manufacturing, Major Group 33, and establishments engaged in producing primary magnesium metal are classified in Manufacturing, Industry 3339. The operation of brine wells or sea water plants for the production of magnesium is classified in Manufacturing, Major Group 28. 

When performed by operators of the properties, exploration under preliminary phases of operation should be classified according to the type of ore expected to be found. Exploration performed on a contract or fee basis is classified in Industry 1081.

    <h1>Division C - Construction</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes establishments primarily engaged in construction. The term construction includes new work, additions, alterations, reconstruction, installations, and repairs. Construction activities are generally administered or managed from a relatively fixed place of business, but the actual construction work is performed at one or more different sites. If a company has more than one relatively fixed place of business from which it undertakes or manages construction activities and for which separate data on the number of employees, payroll, receipts, and other establishment-type records are maintained, each such place of business is considered a separate construction establishment. 

Three broad types of construction activity are covered: (1) building construction by general contractors or by operative builders; (2) heavy construction other than building by general contractors and special trade contractors; and (3) construction activity by other special trade contractors. Special trade contractors are primarily engaged in specialized construction activities, such as plumbing, painting, and electrical work, and work for general contractors under subcontract or directly for property owners. General contractors usually assume responsibility for an entire construction project, but may subcontract to others all of the actual construction work or those portions of the project that require special skills or equipment. General contractors thus may or may not have construction workers on their payroll. 

Building construction general contractors are primarily engaged in the construction of dwellings, office buildings, stores, farm buildings, and other building construction projects. Operative builders who build on their own account for resale are also included in this division. However, investment builders who build structures on their own account for rental are classified in Real Estate, Major Group 65, but separate establishments primarily engaged in construction for the investment builder are classified in this division. 

General contractors and special trade contractors for heavy construction other than building are primarily engaged in the construction of highways; pipelines, communications and power lines, and sewer and water mains; and other heavy construction projects. Special trade contractors are classified in heavy construction other than building if they are primarily engaged in activities such as grading for highway and airport runways; guardrail construction; installation of highway signs; asphalt and concrete construction of roads, highways, streets and public sidewalks; trenching; cable laying; conduit construction;underwater rock removal; pipeline wrapping; or land clearing and leveling. 

Other special trade contractors undertake activities of a type that are either specialized to building construction or may be undertaken for building or nonbuilding projects. These activities include painting (including bridge painting and traffic lane painting) and electrical work (including work on bridges, power lines and power plants). 

Establishments primarily engaged in managing construction projects for others on a contract or fee basis, but assuming no responsibility for completion of the construction project, are classified in Services, Industry 8741. Establishments primarily engaged in renting construction equipment, with or without an operator, are classified in Services, Industry Group 735. 

Force account construction is construction work performed by an establishment primarily engaged in some business other than construction, for its own account and use, and by employees of the establishment. This activity is not included in this division, but is classified according to the primary activity which is or will be performed in the establishment. However, construction work performed as the primary activity of a separate establishment of an enterprise for the enterprise&apos;s own account is included in this division. 

The installation of prefabricated building equipment and materials by general and special trade contractors is classified in this division. Similar installation work performed as a service incidental to sale by employees of an establishment manufacturing or selling prefabricated equipment and materials is classified according to the primary activity in the Manufacturing or Trade Divisions. 

Establishments primarily engaged in the distribution and construction or installation of equipment often present classification problems. Since value added is not available for distinguishing the relative importance of sales versus installation or construction activities, payroll or employment may be used as measures yielding approximately the same results. 

On this basis, separate establishments primarily engaged in the sale and installation of the following illustrative types of structures or integral parts of structures generally site assembled, are classified in construction rather than in trade: 

a. Steel work on bridges or buildings; b. Elevators and escalators; c. Sprinkler systems; d. Central air-conditioning and heating equipment; e. Communications equipment; and f. Insulation materials. 

On the other hand, establishments primarily engaged in the sale and installation of the following illustrative types of preassembled equipment are classified in trade rather than in construction: 

a. Major household appliances, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, stoves and ranges; and b. Partitions for banks, stores, and restaurants.

    <h1>Division D - Manufacturing</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
The manufacturing division includes establishments engaged in the mechanical or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. These establishments are usually described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power driven machines and materials handling equipment. Establishments engaged in assembling component parts of manufactured products are also considered manufacturing if the new product is neither a structure nor other fixed improvement. Also included is the blending of materials, such as lubricating oils, plastics resins, or liquors. 

The materials processed by manufacturing establishments include products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, and quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments. The new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished to become a raw material for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing. For example, the product of the copper smelter is the raw material used in electrolytic refineries; refined copper is the raw material used by copper wire mills; and copper wire is the raw material used by certain electrical equipment manufacturers. 

The materials used by manufacturing establishments may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another which is under the same ownership. Manufacturing production is usually carried on for the wholesale market, for interplant transfer, or to order for industrial users, rather than for direct sale to the domestic consumer. 

There are numerous borderline cases between manufacturing and other divisions of the classification system. Specific instances will be found in the descriptions of the individual industries. The following activities, although not always considered as manufacturing, are so classified: 

Milk bottling and pasteurizing; 

Fresh fish packaging (oyster shucking, fish filleting); 

Apparel jobbing (assigning of materials to contract factories or shops for fabrication or other contract operations) as well as contracting on materials owned by others; 

Publishing; 

Ready-mixed concrete production; 

Leather converting; 

Logging; 

Wood preserving; 

Various service industries to the manufacturing trade, such as typesetting, engraving, plate printing, and preparing electrotyping and stereotype plates, but not blueprinting or photocopying services; 

Electroplating, plating, metal heat treating, and polishing for the trade; 

Lapidary work for the trade; 

Fabricating of signs and advertising displays. 

There are also some manufacturing-type activities performed by establishments which are primarily engaged in activities covered by other divisions, and are, thus, not classified as manufacturing. A few of the more important examples are: 

Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing. Processing on farms is not considered manufacturing if the raw materials are grown on the farm and if the manufacturing activities are on a small scale without the extensive use of paid labor. Other exclusions are threshing and cotton ginning. 

Mining. The dressing and beneficiating of ores; the breaking, washing, and grading of coal; the crushing and breaking of stone; and the crushing, grinding, or otherwise preparing of sand, gravel, and nonmetallic chemical and fertilizer minerals other than barite are classified in Mining. 

Construction. Fabricating operations performed at the site of construction by contractors are not considered manufacturing, but the prefabrication of sheet metal, concrete, and terrazzo products and similar construction materials is included in the Manufacturing Division. 

Wholesale and Retail Trade. Establishments engaged in the following types of operations are included in Wholesale or Retail Trade: cutting and selling purchased carcasses; preparing feed at grain elevators and farm supply stores; stemming leaf tobacco at wholesale establishments; and production of wiping rags. The breaking of bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals, is also classified as Wholesale or Retail Trade. Also included in Retail Trade are establishments primarily engaged in selling, to the general public, products produced on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, ice cream parlors, and custom tailors. 

Services. Tire retreading and rebuilding, sign painting and lettering shops, computer software production, and the production of motion picture films (including video tapes) are classified in Services. Most repair activities are classified as Services. However, some repair activity such as shipbuilding and boatbuilding and repair, the rebuilding of machinery and equipment on a factory basis, and machine shop repair are classified as manufacturing.

<div>

<div>
This major group, known as the cutting-up and needle trades, includes establishments producing clothing and fabricating products by cutting and sewing purchased woven or knit textile fabrics and related materials, such as leather, rubberized fabrics, plastics, and furs. Also included are establishments that manufacture clothing by cutting and joining (for example, by adhesives) materials such as paper and non-woven textiles. Included in the apparel industries are three types of establishments: (1) the regular or inside factories; (2) contract factories; and (3) apparel jobbers. The regular factories perform all of the usual manufacturing functions within their own plant; the contract factories manufacture apparel from materials owned by others; and apparel jobbers perform the entrepreneurial functions of a manufacturing company, such as buying raw materials, designing and preparing samples, arranging for the manufacture of clothing from their materials, and selling of the finished apparel. 

Knitting mills are classified in Industry 2253 if primarily knitting outerwear, and in Industry 2254 if primarily knitting underwear and nightwear. Custom tailors and dressmakers not operating on a factory basis are classified in Retail Trade, Industry 5699; and establishments which purchase and resell finished garments but do not perform the functions of the, apparel jobbers are classified in Wholesale Trade, Industry Group 513.

    <h1>Division E - Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas, And Sanitary Services </h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes establishments providing, to the general public or to other business enterprises, passenger and freight transportation, communications services, or electricity, gas, steam, water or sanitary services, and all establishments of the United States Postal Service. 

For many of the industries in this division, the establishments have activities, workers, and physical facilities distributed over an extensive geographic area. For this division, the establishment is represented by a relatively permanent office, shop, station, terminal, or warehouse, etc. that is either (1) directly responsible for supervising such activities or (2) the base from which personnel operate to carry out these activities. 

Many of the industries are engaged in various related activities. For example, establishments of communications, pipeline, and utility enterprises include a variety of activities, such as power generation, pumping, transmission, and distribution. Establishments primarily engaged in such activities are all classified in this division. Establishments primarily engaged in new or replacement construction for establishments of these types of enterprises are classified as operating establishments in Division C, Construction. Locations engaged in activities such as sales of electric appliances to household consumers are classified in Division G, Retail Trade. 

The establishments classified in this division furnish services to the general public or to other business enterprises; establishments which furnish similar services only to other establishments of the same enterprise are classified as auxiliary to the establishments or units of the enterprise which they serve. However, separate establishments primarily engaged in long-distance trucking, stevedoring, water transportation, or pipeline transportation are classified according to their activity and not as auxiliaries, even though they serve only establishments of the same enterprise.

    <h1>Division F - Wholesale Trade</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes establishments or places of business primarily engaged in selling merchandise to retailers; to industrial, commercial, institutional, farm, construction contractors, or professional business users; or to other wholesalers; or acting as agents or brokers in buying merchandise for or selling merchandise to such persons or companies. 

The chief functions of establishments included in Wholesale Trade are selling goods to trading establishments, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, farm, construction contractors, or professional business users; and bringing buyer and seller together. In addition to selling, functions frequently performed by wholesale establishments include maintaining inventories of goods; extending credit; physically assembling, sorting, and grading goods in large lots; breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots; delivery; refrigeration; and various types of promotion such as advertising and label designing. 

The principal types of establishments included are: (1) merchant wholesalers - wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, voluntary group wholesalers, exporters, importers, cash-and-carry wholesalers, drop shippers, truck distributors, retailer cooperative warehouses, terminal elevators, cooperative buying associations, and assemblers, buyers or cooperatives engaged in the marketing of farm products; (2) sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products; and (3) agents, merchandise or commodity brokers, and commission merchants. 

Establishments primarily engaged in selling merchandise to construction contractors, institutions, industrial users, or businesses are included in Wholesale Trade with a few exceptions. These exceptions are made necessary because of sales to both the general public for personal or household consumption and to businesses, industrial users, or construction contractors. These exceptions are lumber yards; paint, glass, and wallpaper stores, typewriter stores; stationery stores; and gasoline service stations which are classified in Retail Trade, Division G. 

However, establishments that sell similar products only to institutions, industrial users, and establishments that sell merchandise for use exclusively by business establishments or to other wholesalers are classified in Wholesale Trade. Establishments primarily engaged in selling such merchandise as plumbing equipment; electrical supplies; used automobile parts; and office furniture are classified in Wholesale Trade, even if a higher proportion of their sales is made to individuals for household use. Establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of used products are classified on the basis of the products sold. 

Guidelines for the classification of establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution and construction or installation of equipment manufactured by other establishments are outlined in the Introduction to Division C, Construction.

    <h1>Division G - Retail Trade</h1>
    
<div>

<div>
This division includes establishments engaged in selling merchandise for personal or household consumption and rendering services incidental to the sale of the goods. In general, retail establishments are classified by kind of business according to the principal lines of commodities sold (groceries, hardware, etc.), or the usual trade designation (drug store, cigar store, etc.). Some of the important characteristics of retail trade establishments are: the establishment is usually a place of business and is engaged in activities to attract the general public to buy; the establishment buys or receives merchandise as well as sells; the establishment may process its products, but such processing is incidental or subordinate to selling; the establishment is considered as retail in the trade; and the establishment sells to customers for personal or household use. Not all of these characteristics need be present and some are modified by trade practice. 

For the most part, establishments engaged in retail trade sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption. Exceptions to this general rule are lumber yards; paint, glass, and wallpaper stores; typewriter stores; stationery stores; and gasoline service stations which sell to both the general public for personal or household consumption and to businesses. These types of stores are classified in Retail Trade even if a higher proportion of their sales is made to other than individuals for personal or household consumption. 

However, establishments that sell these products only to institutional or industrial users and to other wholesalers and establishments that sell similar merchandise for use exclusively by business establishments are classified in Wholesale Trade. 

Establishments primarily engaged in selling such merchandise as plumbing equipment; electrical supplies; used automobile parts; and office furniture are classified in Wholesale Trade, even if a higher proportion of their sales is made to individuals for personal or household consumption. 

Buying of goods for resale to the consumer is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them from the agricultural and extractive industries. For example, farmers who sell only their own produce at or from the point of production are not classified as retailers. 

Processing incidental or subordinate to selling often is conducted at retail stores. For example, restaurants prepare meals, and meat markets cut meat. Separate establishments selling merchandise for personal or household consumption which has been manufactured by other establishments of the same company are classified in Retail Trade. 

Chain store warehouses are considered auxiliary to the retail establishment served and are classified on the basis of the activity carried on by such retail stores. 

Establishments primarily engaged in the retail sale of used motor vehicles, trailers, and boats are classified in Major Group 55; those selling used mobile homes are classified in Industry 5271; those selling used automobile parts are classified in Wholesale Trade, Industry 5015; and those selling all other used merchandise are classified in Industry Group 593. Establishments primarily engaged in non-store retailing are classified in Industry Group 596.
